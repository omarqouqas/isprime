Make sure the python app file is called "app.py"

SSH to the EC2 instance
cd to /home/ec2-user/isprime

To create a virtual env, run:
python3 -m venv env

To activate the virtual env:
source env/bin/activate

then run: 
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=4444


Then browse to the EC2 public IP (i.e., http://75.101.243.35:4444/), OR "http://ec2-75-101-243-35.compute-1.amazonaws.com:4444/"

Can also check if the flask instance is working locally by ssh'ing to server and using a local instance of the lynx text browser to verify the port is responding. ie


lynx localhost:<port_number>
lynx localhost:4444
