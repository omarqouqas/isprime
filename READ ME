"""To prove whether a number is a prime number, first try dividing it by 2,
and see if you get a whole number. If you do, it can't be a prime number.
If you don't get a whole number, next try dividing it by prime numbers: 3, 5, 7, 11 (9 is divisible by 3)
and so on, always dividing by a prime number (see URL below).
